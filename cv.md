#### About me

I have over seven years of professional and management experience in CEO and PM position. I was working with different teams: copywriters and content managers, designers, developers and sales teams. Also I have extensive experience working with remote teams. For last years I major in project management for software development.

I consider my strengths to be self-organization, proactivity and responsibility

While working as a CEO/Digital Strategist for a news agency "Pushkinska", I increased brand awareness and website traffic from 5,000 to 250,000 people per month.

Managed a startup with a team of 15 people, and also interacted and coordinated work with third-party teams that were engaged in marketing, website development and the mobile application development team of the service. Successfully launched the project and exceeded the financial plan for the first month by 50%.

Currently I work in a company that develops websites and mobile applications as a project manager.

Task: **Remove First and Last Character**

*It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.*

```
function removeChar(str){
 //You got this!
  str = str.substr(1, str.length - 2);
     
  return str
};
```
